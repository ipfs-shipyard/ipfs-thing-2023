  The world wide web is both the biggest deployment vector and least tractable
  surface for IPFS. There are opportunities and major challenges to bringing
  IPFS support in web rendering engines and browsers, to web content served
  through gateways, to IPFS network access from HTTP web apps and browser
  extensions. This track will have talks on: current and future browser
  implementations, approaches to managing and publishing IPFS content on the
  web, building apps that connect to the IPFS from within HTTP contexts,
  culminating in planning for group working sessions around on specific IPFS+Web
  challenges on day 4 & 5 of IPFS þing.

# IPFS on the Web

The world wide web is both the biggest deployment vector and least tractable surface for IPFS. There are opportunities and major challenges to bringing IPFS support in web rendering engines and browsers, to web content served through gateways, to IPFS network access from HTTP web apps and browser extensions. This track will have talks on: current and future browser implementations, approaches to managing and publishing IPFS content on the web, building apps that connect to the IPFS from within HTTP contexts, culminating in planning for group working sessions around on specific IPFS+Web challenges on day 4 & 5 of IPFS þing.
