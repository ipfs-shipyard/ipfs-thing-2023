  The world wide web is both the biggest deployment vector and least tractable
  surface for IPFS. There are opportunities and major challenges to bringing
  IPFS support in web rendering engines and browsers, to web content served
  through gateways, to IPFS network access from HTTP web apps and browser
  extensions. This track will start with a show-and-tell of lightning talks, but
  the primary activity will be a series of working sessions on specific
  challenges. Submissions are open for both!
