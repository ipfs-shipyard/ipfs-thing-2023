  IPFS on the Web The world wide web is both the biggest deployment vector and
  least tractable surface for IPFS. There are opportunities and major challenges
  to bringing IPFS support in web rendering engines and browsers, to web content
  served through gateways, to IPFS network access from HTTP web apps and browser
  extensions. This track will start with a show-and-tell of lightning talks, but
  the primary activity will be a series of working sessions on specific
  challenges - submissions are open for both!
