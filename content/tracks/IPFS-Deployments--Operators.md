    title: 'Enabling More Applications to Join the libp2p DHT Ecosystem'
    description: 'At present, DHT implementations primarily revolve around IPFS. However, it's possible for other applications that leverage libp2p to utilize the DHT without the need to participate in the IPFS DHT and store IPFS data. This presentation outlines a strategy to divide the existing DHT into two parts: a lightweight, multipurpose DHT and an IPFS DHT protocol built on top of it. This proposed approach would enable non-IPFS applications to join the lightweight DHT while running their own protocol on top of it. This would promote interoperability with other applications, contribute to the growth of the libp2p DHT, and enhance the security of all its users.'

    title: 'go-libipfs: build your own IPFS adventure'
    description: 'go-libipfs has been recently proposed as a component library for building IPFS applications and implementations in Go. The goal of this effort is to help people build things. In this talk we will use examples to showcase things that are easy to do with go-libipfs that have been difficult to achieve up to now.
