description: ' IPFS is not an island - it exists in diverse environments, manifesting in different ways depending on the use-case, ranging from mobile devices to blockchains to naming systems, even soon in space. These integration points provide interesting opportunities to explore the capabilities of IPFS and muse on what IPFS even is. We’ll hear from folks on what they’re doing, what’s working, and ponder how far we can flex IPFS to fit the multitude of places it needs to be.'
