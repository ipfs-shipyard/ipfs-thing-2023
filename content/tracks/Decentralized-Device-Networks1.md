  People talk about the Internet of Things, but when are we going to talk about
  the IPFSNet of Things? Embedded devices and their networks provide interesting
  opportunities to explore the capabilities of IPFS and muse on what IPFS even
  is. We’ll hear from folks on what they’re doing, what’s working, and ponder
  how far we can flex IPFS to fit these hard to reach places.
