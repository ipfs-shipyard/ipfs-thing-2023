  This track is about the IPFS community and how we work together to govern IPFS standards and our broader ecosystem: specifications, community organizing, and dweb policy & regulation. What's the latest on the IPFS protocol and governance? What specific problems do we face regarding existing regulation? How can we have better local communities? How do we make the dweb a robust, sustainable commons?
