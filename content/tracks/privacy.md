description: >-
  This track sits at the intersection of IPFS standards, governance, and dweb
  and regulation. What's the latest on the IPFS protocol and governance? What
  specific problems do we face regarding existing regulation? What new
  regulation or changes could be helpful? Are there interesting policy angles
  that we can surface, develop, and advocate for? How do we make the dweb a
  robust, sustainable commons?
