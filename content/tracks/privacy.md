This track is about the IPFS community and how we work together to govern IPFS standards and our broader ecosystem: specifications, community organizing, and dweb policy & regulation. What's the latest on the IPFS protocol and governance? What specific problems do we face regarding existing regulation? How can we have better local communities? How do we make the dweb a robust, sustainable commons?

    title: "Starmaps: a cross-team roadmapping tool"
    description: "I would like to share Starmaps, a tool developed by Protocol Labs that is designed for roadmapping based on Github issues. 

It is especially good to render cross-teams/projects roadmaps, which is perfect to improve visibility inside the network and communicate dependencies more easily. 

We have started using it at Fission, and our goal is to have as many projects as possible from the PLN to be rendered in a single Starmaps in which you could navigate and look at the dependencies between projects.

I think I would need 5-10 minutes (questions aside) to present this."
