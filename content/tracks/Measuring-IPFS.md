    title: "Effectiveness of Bitswap Discovery Process"
    description: "Bitswap is the current data exchange protocol for IPFS. When a new CID is requested, kubo will first broadcast the request to all directly connected peers over Bitswap. If the content wasnâ€™t provided by any connected peers after a timeout, kubo will start a DHT walk to find where the content is located. This talk discusses the effectiveness of the Bitswap discovery broadcast and the use of Bitswap as a Content Router."

    title: "IPFS KPIs: Measure what matters"
    description: "This talk will point us to the right direction on what needs to be measured and monitored as high-level project KPIs for IPFS. It will go beyond low-level network measurements of specific components that make up IPFS to a broader view of the IPFS as a major platform for Web3 applications."
