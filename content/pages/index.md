      - headline: Is there a cost to participate?
        text: >+
          As our IPFS and DWeb community and their excitement continues to grow,
          we are no longer able to sustain our previous model of free events.
          These events require significant overhead and therefore IPFS þing and
          IPFS Camp will be moving to a ticketed & sponsored event structure.
          ​We recognize that times are hard for everyone and therefore have
          proposed tiered pricing for IPFS þing. ​Thank you so much for your
          understanding and we hope to see you in Brussels.


          * Early Bird Builders Ticket | $99 \*Limited availability

          * General Ticket | $650

          * Supporters Ticket | $2000

          * Scholars Ticket | Free (does not include flights or accommodations)


          All meals during the event will be covered for participants.
          Participants (or their employers) are responsible for their flights
          and accommodations.&#x20;


          We have a limited hotel block at the venue, Radisson Grand Place, and
          rooms will be available on a first-come, first-serve basis. You are
          also free to book your own accommodations nearby.

      - headline: 'Can I become a sponsor, what does that include?'
        text: >
